I was born in Los Angeles in 1976 and reared under the love of a hard-working single mom and older sister. As a child, I studied ballet, befriended stray cats and climbed more than my share of trees. I attended Los Angeles County High School for the Arts with a focus on modern dance and site-specific choreography. In 1994, I moved to Seattle with a full scholarship to Cornish College of the Arts Dance Department. However, a bite from the wanderlust bug and a strong inclination towards puppetry caused me to seek education elsewhere. In 1996, I joined a transient street punk performance group called Circus Dischordia and performed as a fire dancer and puppeteer. In 1998, I founded a Bay Area based puppet performance troupe called Mimicry Libre Puppet Theatre and performed at various protests and activist events. Trying to save money for overseas travel, I worked migrant agricultural jobs around the States. By 2000, I was on a plane to Indonesia to study mask carving with the Dell Arte Study Abroad program. My newfound love for Indonesian woodcarving directed an opportunity to become a Darmasiswa Scholar and study Set Construction and Wayang Golek at Sekolah Tinngi Seni Indonesia, Bandung. I also collaborated and stayed with the Javanese artist community, Taring Padi in Yogyakarta. In 2004, I enrolled in California College of the Arts with a major in Sculpture and graduated with distinction in 2007. After graduation I worked as a wheelchair mechanic at National Seating and Mobility and as the Sculpture Shop Technician at UC Berkeley. I attended Machine and Welding Technology programs at Laney College before getting accepted into SFSU MFA program in 2010. I currently live in West Oakland with my dog, Kerosene and Asep the cat. I work as a welding instructor at both TechShop and The Crucible.

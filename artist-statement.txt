Shelter is infused with utmost significance. It is embedded with notions of identity, property and safety as well as emotional factors like comfort and peace. Our survival structures formulate the construct of Home, a place where one belongs. Influenced by my past as a homeless youth, my work dissects this notion of Home and unravels its polarities and contradictions. Some of these explored dichotomies include: normality/absurdity, industry/nature and utopia/dystopia.
My current direction deconstructs the very fundamentals of what makes a Home. I am breaking down and contemplating the edifice itself. I imagine a scenario where human structures have collapsed. With a fabricated world reduced to rubble, survival instincts would take the foreground. Inspired by animal architecture, urban remnants and construction site scraps are the resources of my habitat that are scavenged and wielded into conceptual dwellings. Employing a reverse anthropomorphic approach, these scraps are manipulated and assembled into nested layers that undermine the developed, wild the tame and reconsider the man-made.
